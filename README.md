My projects are;
- BlackOS; a minimal Linux from Scratch OS for ARMv8.
- ProyectoInvierno; an environment for deploy and manage apps in containers.
- LinuxFromScratch-Sources; a repositorie with a huge range of source codes needed for deploy and build an Linux from Scratch. In this project I'm not the owner of the programs, I just do a compilation in a central repositorie because of that many of the programs are as git's submodules.

## Volunteer
I'm volunteer in many BOINC's project and others projects. If you need help in some humanitarian projects which I can help, contact me with the subject "[VOLUNTEER]" and lets talk.
